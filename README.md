# oddlympics

> Your team's matches. In your time zone. One ping before kickoff.

Personalized "when does MY thing happen" notifications for international sports
fans, launching with the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Pick your team, get every match
in your local time zone, and one email an hour before each kickoff. Signup is a
two-field form (team + email) confirmed via a magic-link double-opt-in flow;
after confirming you can follow up to 5 teams from the `/manage` editor.

**Live:** https://oddlympics.app

## What this is

Astro 5 server-mode app on the Node standalone adapter. SQLite for storage,
Resend for transactional email, Caddy in front of a `systemd`-managed Node
process on a single DigitalOcean droplet. GitHub Actions auto-deploys on push
to `main` (~40 seconds end-to-end).

**Shipped and live (toward 2026-06-11 World Cup kickoff):**
- ✅ **v1 MVP** — teaser landing + double-opt-in capture, Phase 1 hardening
  (`/api/unsubscribe`, CSP enforce, default-deny origin, 24h TTL), Phase 2
  magic-link sign-in + tz capture + football-data.org schedule ingestor
  (daily 03:00 timer), Phase 2.5 launch-blast + demand-capture, Phase 3
  kickoff notification cron (5-min timer, dry-run until
  `KICKOFF_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true`).
- ✅ **v2.0 — Consumer Landing & Signup Flow** — Phase 5 schema/payload
  (`vip_signups.team` slug + IANA `timezone`, first non-additive migration),
  Phase 6 consumer landing, Phase 7 `/privacy` + `/terms`, Phase 8 Open Graph
  image, Phase 9 dual-mode `/manage` editor, Phase 10 confirmation-email
  rework (custom verified sender, 10/10 Mail-Tester). Phase 11 launch gate
  run on production: automated ACs + Lighthouse green (Perf 0.97 / A11y 1.0 /
  Best-Practices 1.0 / SEO 1.0); AC-MT (multi-team `/manage`) operator-approved
  on the Phase-12 evidence basis; AC4/AC10/AC11/OG manual checks non-blocking
  by owner decision. Phase 11 closed, tagged **`v1.0-consumer-landing`**.
- ✅ **Phase 12 — multi-team restore** — `/manage` is a 1–5 team
  confederation-grouped checkbox editor backed by a `user_teams` join table;
  signup stays single-team (one slug); the kickoff cron fans out per followed
  team. Verified 11/11.
- ✅ **v2.1 — Referral & Social Sharing** — Phases 13/14/15:
  - **Phase 13** — per-user 8-char `[a-z0-9]` referral code with attribution
    (`referred_by`), additive `pragma_table_info` migration + idempotent
    backfill + UNIQUE index + collision-retry on insert; landing reads
    `?ref=CODE` (30-day first-touch localStorage fallback) and `/api/signup`
    records attribution without ever rejecting.
  - **Phase 14** — share prompts on `/pending`, `/confirmed`, and signed-in
    `/manage`, plus a share line in the confirmation email; one
    `shareText(teamLabel, url)` helper in `src/lib/copy.ts`; Web Share API
    with `navigator.clipboard.writeText` fallback + "Copied!" 1.5s flash;
    AbortError suppression on user cancel; regex-gated `?rc=` before any
    DOM-property assignment.
  - **Phase 15** — new server-rendered `/r/[code]` route emits per-team
    `og:image` + `Following <Team> · oddlympics` title for resolved codes
    (D-01); meta-refresh + try/catch'd `location.replace('/?ref=CODE')` so
    Phase 13 attribution plumbing fires unchanged; unresolved/malformed codes
    return 200 with generic OG (never 404). 48 per-team PNGs (1200×630,
    ~4.1 MB total) under `public/og/` built by `npm run og:render-teams`
    (parameterized `og-image-team.svg` + 6-check per-team gate). All four
    Phase 14 share emitters migrated `/?ref=CODE` → `/r/CODE`. Smoke 19/19
    PASS including new `SHARE-r-known` + `SHARE-r-unknown` cases.
- ✅ **Post-v2.1 pre-launch hardening (quick tasks, 2026-05-23 → 2026-05-24):**
  - **`260523-qqa`** — CSRF Origin check on `/api/save-selection`; RFC 8058
    one-click `POST /api/unsubscribe` handler; `List-Unsubscribe` +
    `List-Unsubscribe-Post` headers on kickoff-alert emails.
  - **`260523-r1x`** — `/manage` magic-link token surface hardening: inline
    `history.replaceState()` scrubs `?token=` from browser address bar +
    history; route-specific `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` response header;
    new `consumed_tokens` SQLite table enforces single-use on
    `purpose=manage` tokens (closes the 24h replay window). New
    `M17-manage-single-use` smoke case in `smoke-manage.mjs`.
  - **`260523-s40`** — Rate-limiter SQLite persistence. New `rate_limit_hits`
    table replaces the in-memory `Map<key, number[]>` so the 5-per-hour cap
    survives process restarts and GitHub Actions deploys (the literal vector:
    a deploy used to wipe counters and grant attackers a fresh budget). IPs
    HMAC-hashed with `MAGIC_LINK_SECRET` before storage (raw IPs never
    persisted); fail-open on DB error. New `scripts/smoke-rate-limit.mjs`
    (RL1/RL2/RL3) proves the DB is the source of truth via direct pre-seed.

**Operator actions remaining (pre-launch, before 2026-06-11):**
1. **Flip kickoff cron live** — set `KICKOFF_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true` in
   `/etc/oddlympics.env`, then `systemctl restart oddlympics-notify.timer`.
2. **End-to-end smoke** one real kickoff notification after the flip.
3. **Verify football-data.org name → slug mapping** (read-only `comm` check;
   silent-loss risk in the kickoff cron — resolver was hardened 2026-05-17 but
   needs one final pre-launch confirmation).
4. **Fire the launch blast** — `scripts/launch-blast.mjs --send` (currently
   dry-run by default).
5. **Walk through the human-UAT items** logged in
   `.planning/phases/13-referral-code-attribution/13-HUMAN-UAT.md` (4 items),
   `.planning/phases/14-share-experience/14-HUMAN-UAT.md` (5 items), and
   `.planning/phases/15-personalized-open-graph/15-HUMAN-UAT.md` (1
   post-deploy item — real social-card unfurl via Twitter/LinkedIn/Facebook/
   Slack validators). See `DEPLOY.md`.

**Deferred (no scheduled milestone):** Telegram bot, Lightning tip jar,
niche-sport long tail (strongman, cubing, etc.).

## Routes

| Route | Method | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | GET | Static hero + signup form |
| `/pending` | GET | "Check your email" — shown after a successful signup |
| `/confirmed` | GET | Confirmation result page (renders correct copy per `?status=` via inline script) |
| `/manage` | GET | Dual-mode: signed-out magic-link form, or (session/`?token=` valid) the 1–5 team confederation-checkbox editor + tz override + schedule preview. Uses the session cookie if valid; otherwise sends a `purpose=manage` link. |
| `/schedule` | GET | **301 → `/manage`**, preserving `?token=` (the editor + schedule live on `/manage` since Phase 9). |
| `/unsubscribed` | GET | Confirmation page after one-click unsubscribe |
| `/r/[code]` | GET | **Phase 15** server-rendered referral route. Emits per-team `og:image` + `Following <Team> · oddlympics` title for resolved 8-char `[a-z0-9]` codes, then meta-refreshes + `location.replace('/?ref=CODE')` so social-card bots scrape the meta and real users land on `/` with Phase 13 attribution intact. Unresolved or malformed codes return 200 with generic OG (never 404). Shape-gated before any DB lookup or HTML echo. |
| `/api/signup` | POST | Validates email + **team** (48-slug allow-list) + **timezone** (IANA-validated, falls back to `America/New_York`), rate-limits, writes SQLite row, mints magic-link, sends via Resend. Bad team rejects with `?error=bad-form`; bad/empty tz falls back silently. |
| `/api/confirm` | GET | Verifies token (purpose=confirm), marks row confirmed (re-subscribe restores an unsubscribed row), redirects to `/confirmed?status=` |
| `/api/manage` | POST | Sends a magic-link with purpose=manage; the link lands on `/manage`, which mints a 30-day session cookie |
| `/api/save-selection` | POST | Authenticated (form token or session) **+ Origin check** (quick-260523-qqa CSRF hardening — rejects same-method cross-origin POSTs). Persists **1–5 team slugs** into `user_teams` (delete-all-then-insert) + `timezone`, atomically in one transaction (a non-active/unsubscribed row is rejected, whole txn rolls back); also inserts the optional demand-capture field into `feature_requests` if non-empty (non-blocking — never gates the team-save) |
| `/api/unsubscribe` | GET / POST | Verifies token (purpose=unsubscribe), sets `unsubscribed_at`, redirects to `/unsubscribed`. **POST handler added in quick-260523-qqa for RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe** (Gmail/Outlook honour `List-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click` headers); POST returns 200 (RFC-mandated, no redirect) instead of 303 |
| `/api/logout` | POST | Clears the session cookie |

## Local dev

Requires Node 22+.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Optionally fill in RESEND_API_KEY and MAGIC_LINK_SECRET in .env.
# Without RESEND_API_KEY, magic links print to the console (dev fallback).
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs on `http://localhost:4321/`. SQLite db is created at
`./data/oddlympics.db` on first request.

## Production build & run

```bash
npm run build           # → ./dist/server/entry.mjs + prerendered HTML
npm run serve           # node --env-file=.env ./dist/server/entry.mjs
```

In production this runs as a `systemd` unit; see `DEPLOY.md`.

## Design choices worth knowing

- **`output: 'server'`**, but the four content pages (`index`, `pending`,
  `confirmed`, `unsubscribed`) set `export const prerender = true;`. Result:
  static pages cached by Caddy with `max-age=31536000`, dynamic API routes +
  the server-rendered `/manage` served by Node. Tiny edge cache, real server
  logic.
- **Shared `Layout.astro`, one light theme, no JS framework.** Every page
  wraps its content in `src/components/Layout.astro`, which owns the
  `<html>`/`<head>` shell (title/description/OG/`noindex`/`analytics`/`footer`
  as props), the unified `:root` design tokens, the base reset, and the shared
  chrome + footer. Pages keep only their own page-specific CSS in a scoped
  `<style>`. Aesthetic is light "editorial minimalist" (`--bg #fafaf7`,
  `--fg #14151a`, accent `#b8350d`); the earlier per-page-inline-style model
  let a dark/light drift creep in, so it was consolidated here.
- **Client-side URL param reads** in the prerendered pages (`?error=`,
  `?email=`, `?status=`) via a small inline `<script is:inline>` — the pages
  stay statically cacheable. `manage.astro` is server-rendered and reads
  `?token=`/cookies in the Astro frontmatter; `/schedule` is a thin 301 to
  `/manage` that preserves `?token=`.
- **Cookie-based sessions, 30-day sliding window** (`src/lib/session.ts`).
  Magic-link flows mint a session token after token verification; the
  cookie is HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Lax. `/manage` and `/schedule`
  use the session if it's valid, otherwise fall back to the magic-link
  email loop. `/api/logout` clears the cookie.
- **Two systemd timers handle background work** under the `oddlympics`
  user with the same hardening directives as the web server:
  - `oddlympics-notify.timer` — every 5 min, picks up matches kicking off
    in 55–65 min and emails subscribers. Idempotent via `UNIQUE
    (user_email, match_id, channel)` on `match_notifications`. Dry-run
    until `KICKOFF_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true` in `/etc/oddlympics.env`.
  - `oddlympics-ingest.timer` — daily 03:00 UTC, refreshes WC 2026
    teams + matches from football-data.org. Idempotent (upsert on `id`).
- **Honeypot + per-IP/email rate limiting** on `/api/signup` and `/api/manage`.
  5 hits/hour per key. Bots get a silent 303 to `/pending` and never touch the
  DB; humans get standard error redirects. As of quick-260523-s40 the limiter
  is **SQLite-backed** (`rate_limit_hits` table) so counters survive process
  restarts and the GitHub Actions deploy cycle — closes the
  "wait-for-deploy-then-burst" vector. IP keys are HMAC-hashed with
  `MAGIC_LINK_SECRET` before storage; raw IPs are never persisted anywhere
  (no Caddy access logs, no journald URL logging, no DB rows).
- **`security: { checkOrigin: false }`** in `astro.config.mjs` because we do
  our own Origin check that allows `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` for local testing
  while blocking cross-origin form posts.
- **`better-sqlite3`** ships a native binding. The deploy workflow runs
  `npm rebuild better-sqlite3` after rsync so the binding is built for the
  droplet's exact Node + glibc.
- **Boot-time idempotent migrations** in `src/lib/db.ts`. New tables use
  `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`; new columns on the existing `vip_signups`
  table use a `pragma_table_info` probe + conditional `ALTER TABLE ADD
  COLUMN` (SQLite has no `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`). The Phase 5 migration
  (first non-additive change) extends this with a SQLite version assert
  (≥ 3.35 for `DROP COLUMN`) and a `has(...)` guard on the `DROP COLUMN
  selected_teams` line — same probe, opposite direction. A NULL-timezone
  backfill `UPDATE` runs once and is a no-op thereafter. Re-running the
  entire boot against a fully-migrated DB is still a no-op. Zero
  migration-tool dependencies. Always run `scripts/backup-pre-05.mjs` on
  the droplet before deploying the Phase 5 commits — see `DEPLOY.md`.
